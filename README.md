# Belly Button Challenge
Using Javascript and Plotly to Build a Simple Interactive Dashboard

## Introduction (Project Background)
An interactive dashboard was built to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The interactive site can be viewed at this [link](https://ns96.github.io/belly-button-challenge/)
